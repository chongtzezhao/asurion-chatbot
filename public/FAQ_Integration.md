# FAQ Integration with meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct Model

This document outlines the process of integrating the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document into the meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model for the Asurion customer support chatbot.

## 1. Overview

The integration is achieved by embedding the FAQ content directly into the system prompt provided to the meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. This approach ensures that the model has the necessary context to answer customer questions accurately and within the defined scope.

The `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` model was chosen for this project because it is a powerful, open-source alternative that does not require a paid API key, unlike models such as GPT-4.

## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1. System Prompt

The core of the integration lies in the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant defined in the `src/config/systemPrompt.ts` file. This constant contains the initial instructions and the full FAQ document that guides the model's behavior.

### 2.2. Service Integration

The `HuggingFaceService` class, located in `src/services/huggingfaceService.ts`, is responsible for communicating with the Hugging Face API. It sends the system prompt, along with the user's query, to the meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model.

## 3. Workflow

1.  The application initializes the `HuggingFaceService`.
2.  When a user sends a message, the application constructs a chat history that includes the `SYSTEM_PROMPT`.
3.  The `HuggingFaceService` sends this chat history to the Hugging Face API.
4.  The meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model uses the information in the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` (including the FAQ) to generate a relevant response.
5.  The response is then displayed to the user.

## 4. Conclusion

This method of embedding the FAQ into the system prompt is a straightforward and effective way to provide the meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a knowledge base. It allows for easy updates to the FAQ content by simply modifying the `systemPrompt.ts` file.
